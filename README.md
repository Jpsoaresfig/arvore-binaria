# Binary Tree

This project involves the implementation of a Binary Tree in Java, developed as a team for the Data Structures I course. The binary tree is a widely used data structure that enables the storage and organization of elements in a hierarchical manner.

## Functionalities

The project includes an interface class called UI that allows interaction with the binary tree through a menu of options. The following functionalities are available:

1.Insert: Allows inserting a new student into the tree by providing the RGM and the student's name.
2.Remove a node: Permits removing a student from the tree by providing the corresponding RGM.
3.Search: Allows searching for a student in the tree by RGM.
4.Empty the tree: Removes all students from the tree, leaving it empty.
5.Display the tree: Allows visualizing the tree in three different orders: pre-order, in-order, and post-order.

## How to run the program

1. Compile o projeto em sua IDE Java favorita.
2. Execute a classe `Java` para iniciar a interface.
3. Siga as instruções exibidas no menu para interagir com a árvore binária.

## Observations

-When inserting a student with an RGM already existing in the tree, a message will be displayed informing that the RGM already exists.
-Before removing a student from the tree, confirmation will be requested.
-When searching for a student in the tree, a message will be displayed indicating whether the student was found or not.
-When emptying the tree, confirmation will be requested.
-When displaying the tree, you can choose the order of display between pre-order, in-order, and post-order.
